<h3> # Omnidirectional_Images_Assessment </h3>
<h4> Omnidirectional Images Assessment </h4>
<div> In this project, I start to research on the Omnidirectional (ˌämniˌdiˈrekSHənl - 3D) Images and how to assess them by Machine Learning and make them as the same result as human perspective </div>
<div> There are two phase</div>
<div>First phase: Pre-processing: Image spliting, PSNR calculating, position of each patch calculate, etc.</div>
<div>Second phase: Apply deep learning to predict MOS of image base on data has been processed on the first phase</div>
